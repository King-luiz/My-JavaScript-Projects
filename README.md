# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript projects focusing on various fundamental and practical concepts, including event handling, event listening, event objects, and creating a gallery. Each project is structured with HTML and JavaScript, with an exception for the `foreachloop` project and `gallery` project, where the JavaScript code is embedded directly within the HTML.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Event Handling**
   - Demonstrates how to handle various events using JavaScript.
   - HTML and JavaScript are organized in separate files for maintainability.

### 2. **Event Listening**
   - Focuses on using `addEventListener` to listen for events on HTML elements.
   - Separates JavaScript code into its own file.

### 3. **Event Object**
   - Explores the `event` object and its properties.
   - Shows how to use the event object to handle and customize behavior.
   - JavaScript code is stored in a separate file.

### 4. **ForEach Loop**
   - Demonstrates the use of the `forEach` loop to iterate through arrays.
   - JavaScript code is embedded directly within the HTML file for simplicity.

### 5. **Creating a Gallery**
   - A practical project that builds an interactive image gallery using JavaScript.
   - **Note**: To run the gallery code as intended, ensure you add your own images to the project folder.

## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd javascript-projects
   ```

3. Open the specific project folder and launch the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the gallery project with animations and responsive design.
- Add more examples for advanced event handling and manipulation.
- Use modular JavaScript for better scalability.
